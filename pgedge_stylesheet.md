Documentation

Apply this stylesheet to .md files only!

Document files should be named in the form my_file.md, and docs for each project should like in the `docs` folder (or sub-directories).

Write in active voice.
Use full and grammatically correct sentences that are between 7 and 20 words long.
Use a semi-colon to link similar ideas or manage sentences that are getting over-long.
Use articles (a, an, and the) when appropriate.
Do not refer to an object as 'it' unless the object 'it' refers to is in the same sentence. It is sometimes ambiguous.

Each file should have one first level heading, and multiple second level headings.  Third and fourth level headings should be used for prominent content only.

Each heading should have an introductory sentence or paragraph that explains the feature shown/discussed in the following section.

If the page has a `Features` or `Overview` section following the introductory paragraph, it should not start with a heading; instead use a sentence in the form:  "The MCP Server includes the following features:", followed by a bulleted list of the features.  When formatting a bulleted list:

* Always leave a blank line before the first item in any list or sub-list (a sub-list may be code or indented bullets under a bullet item).
* Each entry in a bulleted list should be a complete sentence with articles.
* Do not use bold font bullet items.
* Do not use a numbered list unless the steps in the list need to be performed in order.

If a section contains code or a code snippet, there should be an explanatory sentence before the code in the form: In the following example, the command_name command uses a column named my_column to accomplish description-of-what-the-code-does.

Use a single quote around a single command or line of code:  `SELECT * FROM my code;`

Use block quotes around multi-line code samples and include the code type in the format tag:

```sql
SELECT * FROM code;
SELECT * FROM code;
SELECT * FROM code;
```

`stdio`, `stdin`, `stdout`, and `stderr` should be in courier (enclosed in backticks).

Capitalize command keywords; lowercase variables.

Include links to third-party software installation/documentation pages in the Prerequisites section.

Include links to our Github repo when we refer to cloning the repo, or working on the project.

LICENCE.md should live in the docs folder and in the root of each repo.  Create a copy of the LICENCE.md file in the docs folder if there isn't one there already.

Do not create links to github.io.




README.md file notes:

At the top of each README file:

* Include Github Action badges for important actions in use by the repository.
* Include test deployment links (if used for the project).
* Include a Table of Contents that mimics the nav section of the mkdocs.yaml file.
* After the TOC include a link to the online docs, hosted at docs.pgedge.com.

README files should contain the steps required to get started with the project.

This includes the commands to satisfy prerequisites, commands to build/install the binary/project, and notes about the minimal configuration changes required to deploy.

The prerequisites section should link to download/documentation links for third-party software when possible.

In the deployment section, include links to the Installation, Configuration, and Usage pages in the docs/ folder.


At the end of the README:

Include a link to the Issues page for the project:  "To report an issue with the software, visit:"

Include a section/link for Developers/Project contributers that links to developer documentation if available (and if developer documentation is not available, link to the GH site): "We welcome your project contributions; for more information, see docs/developers.md."

Include a link to the online documentation at:  For more information, visit [docs.pgedge.com](docs.pgedge.com)

Last thing in the file, include the sentence: "This project is licensed under the [PostgreSQL License](LICENCE.md)."

The link in that sentence should point to either a symlink from the root of the repo or the version of the LICENCE.md file that resides in the docs folder.

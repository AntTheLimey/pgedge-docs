# Creating Resource Tags

A resource tag is a user-defined key/value information pair that you attach to your cluster definition.  The tag is displayed under the cluster name on the `Clusters` page.  You can use tags to categorize your cloud resources or search for resources that are used for specific teams or applications.  For example, you may want to include a tag that specifies `team: db-ops` to make it easy to identify the resources that are used by the `db-ops` team.
